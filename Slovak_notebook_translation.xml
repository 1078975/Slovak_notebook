            <p>This is a translated 4-page excerpt of a personal notebook used for Slovak language learning. The excerpt was selected based on what pages had a variety of both sentences and grammar notes in consecutive pages. The Slovak-language transcription is also provided on Taylor Editions.</p>
            <p>As a manuscript document that is not always logically structured, the editor made their best attempt to encode the document diplomatically. Writing in blue and black ink appear in their correpsonding colors, and writing in pencil appears in gray. Underlining and deletion is preserved. Spelling mistakes and capitalization inconsistencies are preserved in the translation but not marked by encoding. Sections of text that were written in roughly complete sentences were encoding using the paragraph element, whereas writing that was not was encoded using the anonymous block, note, list, or table elements as appropriate. Divisions are made based on the date of writing, as denoted by a written date or inferred based on the ink color or pencil used. English is set as the standard language of the document, and text in German is marked in the xml:lang attribute on the foreign element or whatever element was more descriptive. Words or parts of words that are untranslatable from Slovak to English are marked using the xml:lang attribute on the foreign element or whatever element was more descriptive.</p>
